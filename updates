Discussed with TA Saleha about potential project topics. 
It was helpful in understand different aspects of this activity, clarifying our objectives and refining our approach.
This guidance was instrumental in shaping our topic selection and overall direction.

Oct 7th, 2024:
On Monday, October 7th, our group held a discussion session where we started with brief introductions to understand each memberâ€™s background and strengths.
We then moved on to brainstorming and researching possible topics for our presentation, carefully considering each option.
After evaluating several topics, we ultimately decided on "Tournament Scheduler" for its technical depth and practical relevance. 
(Further details on this choice can be found in "Discussion #1")

Oct 9th, 2024
We started understanding various concepts regarding the topic.
Understanding Combinatorics and Graph theory.
Their relation with Tournament Scheduling.

(Mid Break)

Oct 20th, 2024:
Started researching on potential subtopics and real-world applications along with presentation planning.

Oct 29th, 2024:
Today, our group conducted a Google Meet session to discuss the project. 
We collaboratively identified key topics and subtopics and divided them among team members for individual research. 
This structure will allow us to cover all necessary areas efficiently and ensures that each member has a specific focus.
(Further details of this can be found in "Discussion #2")

Oct 29th, 2024:
Created "research" file.

Nov 1st, 2024:
(BSCS24147) I started researching on the topics "Definition and Purpose of Tournament Scheduling" and "Main Tournament Formats."

(We were facing problems in getting familiar with Github. 
Thus, it resulted in delay.
However, now after watching tutorials and taking help from seniors we are back on the track.)

Nov 4th, 2024:
(BSCS24147) I have done research on the first topic and started doing on the second one. 
I am also thinking of coding a mini tournament scheduler.

We conducted a group discussion today in university. 
All of us were facing difficulty in our tasks.
We helped each other and reached solution to each of our queries. 

Nov 10th, 2024
(BSCS24147) I uploaded file in the research folder related to the topic.
Now starting working on the slides and further research on different types of tournaments.
