Discussed with TA Saleha about potential project topics. 
It was helpful in understand different aspects of this activity, clarifying our objectives and refining our approach.
This guidance was instrumental in shaping our topic selection and overall direction.

Oct 7th, 2024:
On Monday, October 7th, our group held a discussion session where we started with brief introductions to understand each memberâ€™s background and strengths.
We then moved on to brainstorming and researching possible topics for our presentation, carefully considering each option.
After evaluating several topics, we ultimately decided on "Tournament Scheduler" for its technical depth and practical relevance. 
(Further details on this choice can be found in "Discussion #1")

Oct 9th, 2024
We started understanding various concepts regarding the topic.
Understanding Combinatorics and Graph theory.
Their relation with Tournament Scheduling.

(Mid Break)

Oct 20th, 2024:
Started researching on potential subtopics and real-world applications along with presentation planning.

Oct 29th, 2024:
Today, our group conducted a Google Meet session to discuss the project. 
We collaboratively identified key topics and subtopics and divided them among team members for individual research. 
This structure will allow us to cover all necessary areas efficiently and ensures that each member has a specific focus.
(Further details of this can be found in "Discussion #2")

Oct 29th, 2024:
Created "research" file.

Nov 1st, 2024:
(BSCS24147) I started researching on the topics "Definition and Purpose of Tournament Scheduling" and "Main Tournament Formats."
(bscs24089) I started working on my assigned work that is the code for the showcasing of tournament schedule.

(We were facing problems in getting familiar with Github. 
Thus, it resulted in delay.
However, now after watching tutorials and taking help from seniors we are back on the track.)

Nov 4th, 2024:
(BSCS24147) I have done research on the first topic and started doing on the second one. 
I am also thinking of coding a mini tournament scheduler. 
(bscs24089) I did research on how round robin tournament works.

Nov 8th, 2024
We conducted a group discussion today in university. 
All of us were facing difficulty in our tasks.
We helped each other and reached solution to each of our queries. 

Nov 10th, 2024
(BSCS24147) I uploaded file in the research folder related to the topic.
Now starting working on the slides and further research on different types of tournaments.
(bscs24089) I did research on how single elimination tournament works.

Nov 10th, 2024
(BSCS24147) I added figures for slides.
(bscs24089) I did research on how double elimination tournament works. 
I was fascinated how the type divides the teams and how it mechanism works.

Nov 20th,2024
(bscs24089) I completed the initial setup of my code and thought of the 
logic that would be the building block of the code.
(bscs24147) I started reading research papers on researchgate.com

Nov 23th, 2024
(bscs24089) I implemented the round robin tournament division system in my code.
It prompt the user to enter the game type and number of teams.
then it gives them the number of matches and tells which team would compete with
which one.

Nov 24th, 2024
(bscs24089) I researched how double elimination tournament works as it would also be a part of my 
code and divide the teams accordingly.

Nov 25th, 2024
(bscs24089) I started my work on the double elimination tournament.

Nov 27th, 2024
(bscs24147) Gathered content and created slides.
(bscs24089) Today I researched extensively on Round Robin tournaments for the sake of presentation. I 
studied about it pros and cons, benefits, drawbacks and terminology.

Nov 28th, 2024
(bscs24147) Uploaded half slides on Github.
(bscs24089) compiled data on round robin tournament for presentation.

Nov 29th, 2024
(bscs24089) uploaded mostly completed code. A function is incomplete and it need final touches.
