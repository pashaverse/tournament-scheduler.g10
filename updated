Key Mathematical Constraints:

Time Constraint Function: T(m,s) ≤ D
Where:

m = number of matches
s = time slot duration
D = total available days


Venue Constraint: V ≥ ⌈m/t⌉
Where:

V = number of venues
m = concurrent matches
t = time slots per day


Graph Coloring Solution:

Vertices (V) = matches
Edges (E) = conflicts
Colors (C) = time slots

Fairness Rules:
For n teams where x,y ∈ {1...n}:
|G(x) - G(y)| ≤ 1
Simple Explanation for Presentation:

First slide shows three main constraints:

Time boxes show how matches must fit into available days
Venue boxes show how we need enough courts/fields
Connected circles show teams need fair treatment


Second slide shows:

Different colored circles represent matches
Lines between circles show which matches can't be at same time
Colors represent different time slots
