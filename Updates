Oct 7th, 2024:
On Monday, October 7th, our group held a discussion session where we started with brief introductions to understand each memberâ€™s background and strengths.
We then moved on to brainstorming and researching possible topics for our presentation, carefully considering each option.
After evaluating several topics, we ultimately decided on Tournament Scheduler for its technical depth and practical relevance. 
(Further details on this choice can be found in the "Discussions")
